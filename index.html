                                <p>When she graduate at highschool she was both excited and nervous about starting her college journey. She enrolled at sorsogon college of criminology to pursue her dream to become a law enforcer. Her first year as a criminology student was a journey of both academic and personal challenges. The difference from high school to college was tougher than she expected, especially moving to a new city that she don't know. The academic activities was intense, and criminology, with its complex theories and case studies, demanded more than she was prepared for.  She often struggled to keep up with the activities and assignments, feeling as though she wasn’t able to understand the lessons as quickly as her fellow students. But despite these challenges, her first year was also one of a big impact to her growth Where she learned how to manage her time better, prioritize her mental health, and push through moments of self-doubt. She also learned that life is not just about achieving success in academics or career but about personal growth and resilience.  She faced challenges, whether it was adjusting to college life, dealing with homesickness, or balancing academic and social commitments, but each of these experiences has contributed to er growth as an individual.She is excited for what the future holds and look forward to continuing my studies and eventually making a meaningful contribution to the field of future law enforcer.
